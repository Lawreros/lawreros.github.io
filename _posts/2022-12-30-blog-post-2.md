**Summary:**
Since my last post I'be been busy with several different projects, as well as the pursuit of the next step in my career. As my work with the Department of Cognitive Neurology comes to a stable departing point, I've renewed my focus on getting knowledge/experience on as wide a scope of machine learning methods as possible.

## Project Updates
- The CNNIL model/jupyter notebook is now complete, including descriptions
- The reworking of [iPhone app](../projects/2022-03_PSHR_app/) to now include warning sounds when disconnection has occured. The app was also rewritten in such a way to get rid of unused functions and variables, making the project much easier to maintain.
- Expansion of ML documentation in [Obsidian](../projects/9999_obsidian/)

## Things to check out
- U^2-Net paper
- CNNIL link
