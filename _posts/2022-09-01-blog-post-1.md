**Summary:**
Creating a place to document my personal and professional efforts over my career. This website will serve as a more detailed resume/CV for individuals not wanting to crawl through my Github repositories.

## "You already have a CV, LinkedIn, and Github profile, why have this website"?
While it is true that a lot of my work is available to The purpose of this website is two-fold:
1. 
2. 


Creating  place to document my personal and professional efforts. Let's see how long the preview can keep track of things for me as I keep writing something worth reading. I really hope that I can keep doing this and adding to this website. I guess I'll have to add something every week. That wouldn't be so bad, you know? Have a monthly update on the things that are going on in my life (from a professional perspective, of course, though I could create some weird encryption for the secret posts and parts of this website that are just for friends. That would be pretty cool.)

Or does it not keep track of the second line. I hope that is the case.
