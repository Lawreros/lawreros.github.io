## Professional Interests:
While I'm interested in a wide variety of subjects, my professional work has revolved around a few core topics. If your work involves any of the following and you wish to work together, please down hesitate to contact me:

### 1. Medical Imaging and Analysis:
While I enjoy working with analysis of images of all types, medical images have always been a particular fascination of mine since I took a *Medical Image Analysis* class at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). The challenge of 2D/3D/4D image analysis (sometimes across modalities) with the undeniable benefit of further refinement of collection/analysis techniques in the field captivates me.
### 2. Machine Learning:
While this is a particularly broad topic, the application of ML techniques on medical images in particular is a passion of mine. Most of my experience involves convolutional neural networks, but I'm always expanding my experience with other techniques. You can visit at the `Projects` page for examples of these projects.
### 3. Open-Source efforts:
I am a firm believer in open-source code. I try my best to make all of my work publically available, with good documentation so it can be utilized by others. While I've only contributed to 2-3 larger code repositories, I plan on increasing this as my skills improve.

## Projects
While my work keeps me busy, I try to continually expand my skillset by working on personal projects. This mainly takes the form of coding prototypes of interesting things I read in journals in order to gain a better understanding. To see the various projects I have finished/am currently working on, please visit the `Projects` page. There I provide more detailed descriptions and links to my work.

## About Me
I grew up in [Springfield, PA](https://www.springfielddelco.org/), just outside of Philadelphia. I recieved a B.S. in Bioengineering from the [University of Pittsburgh](https://www.engineering.pitt.edu/bioengineering), with a minor in Mechanical Engineering. While I originally worked with muscle regeneration in a wet lab environment, I eventually found myself working with medical images after an influential class at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). After graduation I worked at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine researching memroy development in children, which entailed collecting MRI data from children as they performed memory tasks. I later worked with Dr. Joshua Vogelstein on the connectome analysis pipeline m2g, during which I recieved my M.S.E. in Bioengineering at [Johns Hopkins](https://www.bme.jhu.edu/), with a Data Science concentration.

I'm currently a Senior Programmer Analyst in the Johns Hopkins University [Department of Cognitive Neurology](https://web.jhu.edu/cognitiveneurology/) studying the relationship between physiological signals and affect in individuals with ASD-3. Because most individuals with ASD-3 are nonverbal and have difficulty outwardly displaying their discomfort/feelings, they are prone to outbursts/problematic behavior without significant warning. The goal of this project is to research predictive methods which can be used as tools to notify caretakers/teachers of oncoming problematic episodes so they can be preemptively addressed.

## Monthly Work Updates
For updates on what I'm doing on a month-by-month basis, take a look at the `Blog Posts` page. There I write short updates on interesting things I'm working on.
