The [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) note taking system is something I was introduced to in the summer of 2021 and has been a consistent pet-project that I hope to continue working on for essentially the rest of my life. The note taking system is based off of the (Zettelkasten)[https://zenkit.com/en/blog/a-beginners-guide-to-the-zettelkasten-method/] organizational method, which emphasizes breaking down complex ideas into their component concepts and exploring the connections between those concepts.
As all of the notes are markdown files, if for some reason Obsidian is no longer supported/is removed for some reason, all of the notes are still readable by any file editor.

As the offical website says:
*"Obsidian uses Markdown. Markdown is widely used by sites like Reddit and GitHub and not going away anytime soon. Markdown is designed to be human readable. It's not obfuscated by encoding; you can directly edit the source files with Markdown editors, or edit them automatically with scripts."*

All (non-confidential/personal) notes that I take as I learn new concepts worth cataloging are backed up on my Github account as the [Ross Vault](https://github.com/Lawreros/Ross_Vault) repository. The repository is publically available and I encourage anyone interested in the topics listed in the README.md to give it a look.
