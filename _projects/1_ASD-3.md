As part of the [Department of Cognitive Neurology](https://web.jhu.edu/cognitiveneurology/) at Johns Hopkins, I've been working with a team of researchers and teachers to explore the relationship between physiological signals (such as heart rate, through ECG) and observable affect (crying, self-injurious behavior, etc.) in individuals with [ASD-3](https://www.verywellhealth.com/what-are-the-three-levels-of-autism-260233). There are two distinct goals for this study:

*Disclaimer: I am not an expert with respect to ASD-3, my responsibilities are mainly technology and analysis*

1. **Practical:** Due to the fact that many individuals with ASD-3 are non-verbal, they are unable to communicate their needs and intentions effectively and are prone to outbursts with little warning. We aim to provide tools which give teachers and other caretakers insight into the emotional state of individuals with ASD-3, as well as warnings about the potential for outbursts in the immediate future. This gives them time to adjust or redirect the individual.
2. **Theoretical:** The ASD-3 population is massively understudied; both due to its relativly small size and due to the difficulty involved in having individuals with ASD-3 perform tasks in a research environment. Most reaserch involving autism studies ASD-1 and extrapolates the findings onto ASD-3 (with little empirical support).
