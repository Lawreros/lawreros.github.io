Super-resolution imaging (SR) is a [class of techniques](https://blog.paperspace.com/image-super-resolution/) which aim to increase the resolution of images. I'm specifically interested in the use of SR with respect to medical imaging (namely MRI, as that is what I have the most experince with).
As I explore the different techniques for SR and read interesting papers, I plan on writing code for papers which do not have readily available code to play around with. This is both for my own understanding, as well as helping those poor students who need code to fully understand a paper. All of this exploration will be kept in this [public Github repository](https://github.com/Lawreros/Super-Resolution).
